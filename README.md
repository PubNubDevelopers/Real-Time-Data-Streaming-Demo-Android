# Demo: Real-Time Data Streaming with PubNub on Android

**PubNub makes it easy to connect and consume massive real time streaming data and deliver usable information to any number of subscribers.** These "firehoses of data" could be weather reports, business metrics, stock quotes, tweets - really any source of data that is constantly changing and emitting updates. PubNub’s Network handles keeping both publishers and subscribers securely connected and ensuring that every piece of data is generally available in real time, so scale (or the amount of data you’re sending) is never an issue.

We’ve built sample realtime data streams to make it easy for you to prototype your streaming application.  It is those sample data streams that are consumed by this demo app.
